# Stan parallel computation framework

This repository is a temporary location for the installation instructions (with example) for the parallel computation framework for the [Stan](https://mc-stan.org/) software for Bayesian inference.

The framework has been integrated with Stan code, which can be found at [stan-dev](https://github.com/stan-dev), in particular, in Stan and Stan Math library.

Information on functions (and signatures) that have parallel computation support can also be found in the [Stan language functions reference](https://mc-stan.org/users/documentation/).

We maintain an up-to-date description of the framework and implementation details for some of the GPU-optimized algorithms in this [arXiv paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.01063).

GPU support installation instructions for [CmdStan](https://mc-stan.org/users/interfaces/cmdstan), the shell interface to Stan, can be found [here](install_docs/INSTALL_CMDSTAN.md).

GPU support installation instructions for [CmdStanR](https://mc-stan.org/cmdstanr/), a lightweight interface to Stan for R users, can be found [here](install_docs/INSTALL_CMDSTANR.md).
